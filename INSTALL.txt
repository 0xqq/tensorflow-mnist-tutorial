Python 3 is required for this lab.

If you have problems with these installations instructions, visit tensorflow.org for
additional installation options (virtualenv, docker) and follow the Python 3 instructions.

MacOS:
	If you do not have it already, install git form https://git-scm.com/download/mac
	Install the latest version of python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
	pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
	pip3 install --upgrade matplotlib

Windows:
    (This code lab should work under cygwinX, however it had not been tested, which is why Virtualbox is recommended)
	Install Virtualbox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
	Create an Linux/Ubuntu virtual machine and install Ubuntu from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/
	[Optional: In the virtual machine install Virtualbox helpers (allows screen resolution changes) using:
	 sudo -H apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
	 sudo -H apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms
	 Open “Additional drivers” app and check that the “Virtualbox Graphics Adapter” and “Virtualbox Guest Service” are selected.]
	Shut down the virtual machine, max out its video RAM and CPU settings, allocate 4GB of RAM and restart.
	Now go to Ubuntu/Linux section.

Ubuntu/Linux:
	sudo -H apt-get install git
	sudo -H apt-get install python3
	sudo -H apt-get install python3-matplotlib
	sudo -H apt-get install python3-pip
	sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade  https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl
		(if this fails with a “wheel not supported” message, the workaround is to download the file and rename the
		“cp34”s in the file to “cp35”s and then do the pip3 install. Here are the command lines for the workaround:
		curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl
		mv tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl tensorflow-0.8.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
		sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-0.8.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
		)
		(When testing the installation, if you get an error about “cycler”, please update cycler using:
		sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade cycler
		This is caused by a misconfigured dependency in matplotlib and will hopefully be fixed in the next release.
		)

TEST YOUR INSTALLATION:
    git clone https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-mnist-tutorial.git
    cd tensorflow-mnist-tutorial
    python3 mnist_1.0_softmax.py
    => A window should appear displaying a graphical visualisation and you should also see training data in the terminal.
